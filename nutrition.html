        <h3>Food for Thought</h3>
        <img class="nutrition1" src="img/nutrition1.jpg" alt="Nutrition" />
        <p>
          Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of
          thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food
          for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a
          lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big
          results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile
          apps available to help track your activity level and calories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself
          to one "cheat" meal a week.

        <h3>What to Eat</h3>
        <img class="nutrition2" src="img/nutrition2.jpg" alt="Nutrition 1" />
        <p>Use the following as a guideline:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat</li>
          <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
          <li>Fruit</li>
          <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed
          food. These foods are high in carbohydrates.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic
          when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond flour, and flax
          seed.
